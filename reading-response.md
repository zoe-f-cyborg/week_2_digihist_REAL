# Exploitation or Collaboration? 

I missed what the appropriate window of time to respond to a question brought up on discord about which 
articles grabbed my interest, but I did want to take a moment here to discuss them! 

### The Transcribe Bentham Project

The articles about this project, which we looked at this week, were very intriguing to me. 
I've done some reading for librivox in the past and in general am very drawn to the notion of "copyleftism" and crowdsourced/opensource software.
However, I do think these articles illutrated for me some of the discomforting things about crowdsourcing under capitalism.

I am thinking especially of the 2018 piece, "‘Making such bargain’: Transcribe
Bentham and the quality and
cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced
transcription." Becuase Causer & co. were writing from an academic perspective, and about the economic practicalities 
of crowdsourcing, I was struck with the sense that it's kind of impossible for the work to not be at all exploitative.
Yes, the volunteers may enjoy it, and yes, it may all be for an ultimately good cause, but I worry about how thinking of 
these projects in terms of economic viability might result in a more exploitative atmsophere in the digital humanities. 
After all, "never pay for work somebody will do for free," to paraphrase Carole Baskin. 

Obviously I know very little about this in practice, and very little about what the field actually looks like, 
but it seems to me that if free labour becomes assumed or expected by researchers in this field, that might not be a good thing 
for the quality of these projects (both ethically and practically).
