# Collaboration or Exploitation? 

I missed the appropriate window of time to respond to a question brought up on discord about which 
articles grabbed my interest, but I did want to take a moment here to discuss them! So I did so here: 

### The Transcribe Bentham Project

The articles about this project, which we looked at this week, were very intriguing to me. 
I've done some reading for librivox in the past and in general am very drawn to the notion of "copyleftism" and crowdsourced/opensource software. However, I do think these articles illutrated for me some of the discomforting things about crowdsourcing under capitalism / in conjuction with profit-oriented projects.

I am thinking especially of the 2018 piece, "‘Making such bargain’: Transcribe Bentham and the quality and cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced transcription." Becuase Causer & co. were writing from an academic perspective, and about the economic practicalities of crowdsourcing, I was struck with the sense that it's kind of impossible for the work to not be at all exploitative. 

I worry about how thinking of these projects in terms of economic viability might result in a more exploitative atmosphere in the digital humanities in general. After all, "never pay for work somebody will do for free," to paraphrase Carole Baskin. There is inevitably a profit motive involved in this work-- it is for the purpose of compiling and publishing a book which people will be paid to edit, market, and print. And where there is a profit motive, there is always the breeding ground for exploitation, if it is not inherently exploitative. Volunteers might be encouraged or coerced into working when they don't want to, out of a sense of loyalty or responsibility, or using parasocial rhetoric to make them feel guilty for quitting. There is the potential, the motive, for this kind of behaviour, in any profit-driven system. 

This fact-- that some people will be compensated for the labour of producing this book while others (the transcribers) will not-- is seemingly ignored becuase of the moral goodness of the work itself. I sympathize with this view, as I also *really want* this work to happen, and I'm particularly interested in reading some of those saucy personal letters. However, the fact that I want the end product of this venture is no more a convincing case that it should happen, than the fact that Jeff Bezos wants another yacht is a convincing case that he should continue not paying taxes. The researchers seem to take it as a given that if volunteers enjoy the work, then it cannot be exploitative, but I think that is a leap in logic. Were those 7 super volunteers, who I can only assume were working on that project basically full-time, truly not exploitated simply becuase they chose to be there, and enjoyed the work? When others will almost certainly profit from their labour? And their rights, even to recognition, are seemingly unprotected? 

Obviously I know very little about this in practice, and very little about what the field actually looks like, 
but it seems to me that if free labour becomes assumed or expected by researchers in this field, that might not be a good thing for the quality of these projects (both ethically and practically).
