A list of words I do not know, hopefully with definititions added once I figure out what they mean for me

command line = "an interface for typing commands directly to a computer's operating system."

- encountered this in relation to anaconda, both as an option for a type of installer and when the prof said "we’ll mostly use python at the command line." 
- for me, this means using something called the "terminal" (on my laptop, applications -> other -> terminal)

terminal prompt (signified with $ in code examples) = the window(?) in which I enter code into the command line

homebrew = "a ‘package manager’, or a utility that retrieves software from a single, ‘official’ (as it were) source."

- I understand almsot none of these words but will perservere
