A list of words I do not know, hopefully with definititions added once I figure out what they mean for me

command line = "an interface for typing commands directly to a computer's operating system."

- encountered this in relation to anaconda, both as an option for a type of installer and when the prof said "weâ€™ll mostly use python at the command line."
