[Intro]

### Anaconda 

I have downloaded this software before for another class (though I was on a different laptop at the time),
so I was (somewhat) familiar with it.

It did take me a shamefully long time to figure out how to access the command line, but I eventually got it. 

### Wget

#### Homebrew

- the ask for a passwrod to install homebrew briefly had me stumped, until I realized it was the password for my laptop itself (not somethign specific to python).
- I got this message after my first attempt at installing: 
``` 
Error downloading Command Line Tools for Xcode: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (PKDownloadError error 8.) 
Done.
Error downloading updates.
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/rm -f /tmp/.com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand.in-progress
==> /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select: error: invalid developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools'
Failed during: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
``` 

I went to [this](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/homebrew) website, which told me to 
download "Xcode" from the apple app store. I did, and then the homebrew installation worked.
