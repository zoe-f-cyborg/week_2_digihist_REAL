# WGET CHEAT SHEET

These are all the commands for using wget that seem relevant to me, organized in such a way that they are easier for me to remember/come back to:

### `pwd`
- checks where you currently are on your computer (which file or "directory" you are working within and which anything you pull will end up)
- `~` means you are in the most general section, the "main users folder," and you almsot definitely do not want to be there becuase you almost definitely will not be able to find that file again.

### `cd [file name]`
- this takes you to whichever directory you want to go to.
- for some reason, when you are in a sub-file of a file, `cd [file name]` will not take you directly to the 

### `mkdir [file name]`
- this creates a new file
